# React Native Swiss Knife

This project is created to fill the gap of missing common APIs in react-native. Every native and JS code separated by modules so You don't have to put all the modules into your project in order to use only one.

## The Truth

It's kind of suck that for any small modules I have to create a repo and then find a name that hopefully not taken by another dude. If you feel the pain, then help me fix this. I'm working on the clock to make this module fully functional with `rnpm`. at the moment you should do it manually.

## Contribution

if you plan to help me improve or adding new module, please put the new modules into separate package. You can see the text package in side modules folder.

Please send me the PR and I will be happy to put your module along side your name here.
